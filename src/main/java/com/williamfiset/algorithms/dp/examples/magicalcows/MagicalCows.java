/**
 * Solution to Magical Cows (https://open.kattis.com/problems/magicalcows)
 *
 * <p>Problem author: Graeme Zinck
 *
 * <p>Solution by: William Fiset
 *
 * <p>The main thing to realize with magical cows is that the total number of cows allowed on each
 * farm is bounded by C which is less than or equal to 1000, so you can keep track of all cows in a
 * frequency table for each farm size.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: You can ignore taking the floor/ceiling of the number of cows on a split since when you
 * double the number of cows you always get an even number.
