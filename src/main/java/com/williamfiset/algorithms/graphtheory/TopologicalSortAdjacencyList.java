/**
 * This topological sort implementation takes an adjacency list of an acyclic graph and returns an
 * array with the indexes of the nodes in a (non unique) topological order which tells you how to
 * process the nodes in the graph. More precisely from wiki: A topological ordering is a linear
 * ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes
 * before v in the ordering.
 *
 * <p>Time Complexity: O(V + E)
